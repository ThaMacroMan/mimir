Steps to becoming a Cardano Developer using Mnemos and MeshJS

1. Open Cursor, open terminal
2. npx meshjs [appname]
3. Agent Prompt: /Generate Cursor Rules create me some rules for building a website that include the best practice for maintainability, readability, performance, security, and reliability when building a nextjs website
4. Build a prompt, descibing the goal of your project, and generate a plan to execute this goal with /Generate Cursor Rules
5. Using our Best Practices.md and Plan.md files, feed these to the AI and use /Generate Cursor Rules one last time, so we can a list of tools we will be using in the project, along with a description to help understand each tool and what its used for.
6. We can also generate additional rules, such as giving the AI a link to a website we like the style of to give it some examples of what were trying to build. For Example: /Generate Cursor Rules I want to slightly mimic the style of @https://meshjs.dev/ but with a focus on being approachable, simple, and clean
7. Begin Building! Now that we have built our plan/rules setup, we are set to begin building the project. We build simply by talking (also called prompting) the AI in our Coding platform

Models: Each model is good at different things, and trial and error is king in learning what you like to use best. Currently, o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4 are all incredible and any of them will work for building.

Errors: When building, you will run into many errors. Luckily, our handy AI Assistants are excellent at solving them for us! As we learn more and gain experience, fixing the errors becomes easier. To begin, simply copy the error into the AI and get it to fix it!
