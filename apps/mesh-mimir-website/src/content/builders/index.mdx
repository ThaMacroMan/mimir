# New Builder: Start Here

Welcome. This track is designed to get you productive fast, without assuming prior blockchain or AI experience.

<Callout type="info" title="What you’ll achieve">
  - Understand which AI tools to use first (and why) - Learn the day‑to‑day
  workflow we expect you to follow - Get a clear mental model of Cardano
  fundamentals
</Callout>

## AI coding tools (the simple starting set)

### ChatGPT (Beginner‑friendly)

- **What it is**: A general AI assistant for questions, explanations, and quick guidance.
- **When to use**: Brainstorming, concept explanations, step‑by‑step walkthroughs.
- **Plans**: Free tier is fine to start; paid offers better reasoning and longer context.

### Cursor (Beginner → Intermediate)

- **What it is**: A code editor with built‑in AI that edits files, runs diffs, and helps refactor.
- **When to use**: Implementing changes, navigating a codebase, creating components/pages, applying edits.
- **Plans**: Free to start; paid tiers unlock longer context and faster assistance.

### Windsurf (Optional, Cardano‑focused)

- **What it is**: AI assistant tuned for blockchain workflows and repo‑scale tasks.
- **When to use**: Larger refactors, new feature scaffolds, or Cardano‑specific guidance.
- **Plans**: Paid tiers recommended for heavier usage.

<Callout type="success" title="Keep it simple">
  Start with ChatGPT for understanding, then move to Cursor as soon as you’re
  ready to write and modify code inside the repo. Windsurf is helpful later for
  larger tasks.
</Callout>

## How we use AI day‑to‑day

- **Small, focused tasks**: Ask for one change at a time. Avoid multi‑goal prompts.
- **Structured prompts**: Provide file paths, constraints, acceptance criteria.
- **Edits, not walls of code**: Prefer file edits and diffs over pasted blobs.
- **Review everything**: Never merge AI output blindly. Run, test, verify.
- **Tight feedback loop**: Build → Run → Inspect → Iterate.

### Minimal setup checklist

- Create a **ChatGPT** account (free tier OK).
- Install **Cursor** and sign in.
- Ensure **Node 18+** is installed.
- Optionally create a **Windsurf** account for later phases.

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
  Never share seed phrases or private keys with any AI tool. Use test wallets
  for development. Keep secrets in environment variables, not committed to git.
</Callout>

## Cardano in 5 minutes (mental model)

- **Asset & unit**: ADA (smallest unit: Lovelace).
- **Wallets**: Manage keys and addresses; connect via browser wallets or SDKs.
- **UTXO model**: Transactions consume UTXOs and produce new ones; think of them like spendable “bills.”
- **Networks**: Mainnet (real ADA) vs Testnets (practice). We’ll use a test network for learning.
- **Providers**: Third‑party APIs (e.g., Blockfrost) to query chain data without running a node.

### What this means for you

- You’ll build transactions by selecting inputs (UTXOs) and outputs.
- You’ll use a wallet integration (Mesh React hooks/components) for UX.
- You’ll call a provider for data (balances, UTXOs, status).

## What’s next

- Set up your AI tools and editor preferences.
- Learn the repo’s structure and how we author content with MDX.
- Prepare a test wallet and provider key (we’ll show you when needed).

<Callout type="info" title="You’re on track">
  Next, we’ll move into practical flows: repository navigation, branching, and
  your first change requests. No on‑chain code yet—just confidence with the
  workflow.
