# Cursor Setup üöÄ

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that will revolutionize how you write Cardano code. It's like having a brilliant coding partner who understands your project and helps you build faster.

## What is Cursor?

Cursor is a code editor built on VS Code that integrates AI directly into your development workflow. It can:

- **Generate code** from natural language descriptions
- **Explain code** you don't understand
- **Debug issues** by analyzing your code
- **Refactor code** to improve quality
- **Answer questions** about your project

## Why Cursor for Cardano Development?

- **Cardano-aware**: Understands blockchain concepts and patterns
- **TypeScript support**: Excellent for MeshJS and modern Cardano development
- **Git integration**: Seamless version control for your projects
- **Extensible**: All VS Code extensions work with Cursor

## Installation

### Step 1: Download Cursor

1. Go to [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. Click "Download for [Your OS]"
3. Install the application

### Step 2: First Launch

1. Open Cursor
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (recommended)
3. Choose your preferred theme and settings

### Step 3: Install Extensions

Install these essential extensions for Cardano development:

```bash
# Essential extensions
- TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
- Prettier - Code formatter
- ESLint
- GitLens
- Auto Rename Tag
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
```

## Configuration

### AI Settings

1. Open Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`)
2. Search for "AI" or "Cursor"
3. Configure your preferred AI model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet recommended)
4. Set your API key if using custom models

### Cardano Development Setup

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed)
2. **Install MeshJS**: `npm install @meshsdk/meshjs`
3. **Configure TypeScript** for strict mode

### Recommended Settings

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "relative",
  "editor.suggestSelection": "first",
  "editor.tabCompletion": "on"
}
```

## Your First AI-Powered Coding Session

### 1. **Open a Project**

- Create a new folder for your Cardano project
- Open it in Cursor
- Initialize a new Node.js project: `npm init -y`

### 2. **Ask Cursor to Help**

Open the AI chat (`Cmd/Ctrl + L`) and try:

```
"I want to create a simple Cardano wallet using MeshJS. Can you help me set up the basic structure?"
```

### 3. **Generate Code**

Ask Cursor to:

- Create the project structure
- Set up basic dependencies
- Generate a simple wallet implementation

### 4. **Iterate and Improve**

- Ask questions about the generated code
- Request improvements and optimizations
- Get explanations for complex parts

## Cursor AI Commands

### Chat Commands

- `Cmd/Ctrl + L` - Open AI chat
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` - Quick AI command
- `Cmd/Ctrl + I` - Inline AI edit

### Code Generation

- Select code and ask for explanations
- Use `/edit` to modify existing code
- Use `/explain` to understand complex code

### Project Help

- Ask about project structure
- Get help with dependencies
- Debug issues step by step

## Best Practices for Cardano Development

### 1. **Start with Clear Prompts**

```
‚ùå "Help me build a dApp"
‚úÖ "Create a simple Cardano NFT minting dApp with React and MeshJS"
```

### 2. **Use Context**

- Show Cursor your existing code
- Explain your project goals
- Reference specific Cardano concepts

### 3. **Verify and Test**

- Always test generated code
- Verify Cardano-specific logic
- Check for security best practices

### 4. **Learn as You Go**

- Ask Cursor to explain generated code
- Request alternative approaches
- Get help with debugging

## Common Cardano Development Tasks

### Setting Up a Project

```
"Create a Next.js project structure for a Cardano dApp with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MeshJS integration"
```

### Wallet Integration

```
"Show me how to connect a Cardano wallet using MeshJS and handle wallet state in React"
```

### Transaction Building

```
"Create a function to build a simple ADA transfer transaction using MeshJS"
```

### Error Handling

```
"Help me add proper error handling for Cardano wallet connection failures"
```

## Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding

- Check your internet connection
- Verify API key settings
- Restart Cursor

### Code Generation Issues

- Be more specific in your prompts
- Provide more context about your project
- Break complex requests into smaller parts

### Performance Issues

- Close unnecessary files
- Disable heavy extensions
- Restart Cursor periodically

## Next Steps

Now that Cursor is set up, let's build something real:

- [Your First Transaction](/guides/first_transaction) - Build a simple Cardano transaction
- [NFT Collection](/guides/nft-collection) - Create an NFT minting dApp
- [Live Coding](/docs/live-coding) - Watch AI-assisted development in action

## Practice Exercise

**Try this in Cursor:**

1. Create a new folder called `cursor-cardano-demo`
2. Open it in Cursor
3. Ask Cursor: "Help me create a simple HTML page that explains Cardano to beginners"
4. Ask follow-up questions about the generated code
5. Request improvements and modifications

**Challenge**: Use Cursor to help you understand one concept from the generated code that you're curious about.

**Pro Tip**: Cursor gets better the more you use it. The AI learns your coding style and project patterns, so don't be afraid to experiment and ask lots of questions!
