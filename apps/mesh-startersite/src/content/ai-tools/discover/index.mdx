# Discover AI Tools

Welcome to the world of AI-powered development! In this chapter, you'll learn about the essential AI tools that will transform how you build on Cardano.

## What are AI Tools?

AI tools are software applications that use artificial intelligence to help developers write code, debug problems, and build applications faster. Think of them as having a brilliant coding partner who never gets tired and can help you 24/7.

<Callout type="info" title="Why AI Tools Matter">
  AI tools can reduce development time by 50-80% and help you focus on the
  creative aspects of building rather than repetitive coding tasks.
</Callout>

## The AI Tool Landscape

There are three main categories of AI tools you'll encounter:

### 1. Code Editors with AI

- **Cursor**: Advanced code editor with AI assistance
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI pair programmer
- **Tabnine**: Code completion and suggestions

### 2. AI Chat Assistants

- **ChatGPT**: General-purpose AI assistant
- **Claude**: Advanced reasoning and analysis
- **Bard**: Google's AI assistant

### 3. Specialized Development Tools

- **Windsurf**: AI-powered development environment
- **Replit**: Online IDE with AI features
- **CodeWhisperer**: AWS's AI coding assistant

## Choosing Your AI Tool

<Quiz
  question="Which AI tool is best for beginners who want to learn Cardano development?"
  options={[
    {
      id: "cursor",
      text: "Cursor - It has excellent TypeScript support and AI assistance",
      isCorrect: true,
      explanation:
        "Cursor is perfect for beginners because it provides real-time AI assistance while you code.",
    },
    {
      id: "chatgpt",
      text: "ChatGPT - It can answer any programming question",
      isCorrect: false,
      explanation:
        "While ChatGPT is helpful, it's not a code editor and requires switching between tools.",
    },
    {
      id: "windsurf",
      text: "Windsurf - It's specifically designed for blockchain development",
      isCorrect: false,
      explanation:
        "Windsurf is great but might be overwhelming for complete beginners.",
    },
  ]}
  explanation="For beginners, Cursor provides the best balance of AI assistance and learning experience. It helps you write code while teaching you the concepts."

## Getting Started

The key is to start with one tool and master it before adding others. We recommend starting with **Cursor** because:

1. **Excellent TypeScript Support**: Perfect for Cardano development
2. **AI Chat Integration**: Built-in AI assistant
3. **Free Tier Available**: No cost to get started
4. **Active Community**: Lots of resources and help available

<Callout type="success" title="Pro Tip">
  Don't try to learn all AI tools at once. Pick one, master it, then gradually
  add others to your toolkit.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, you'll learn how to set up Cursor and start using it for your first Cardano project. You'll discover how AI can help you:

- Write code faster
- Debug problems more efficiently
- Learn new concepts through examples
- Build better applications
