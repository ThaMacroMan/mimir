# Mnemos ‑ Cardano Beginners Guide

The Mnemos initiative aims to transform absolute beginners into proficient Cardano developers by leveraging modern AI tooling and carefully-curated learning material.

## Phase 1 – ‘0 → 1, but with AI’

The core of Phase 1 is to build an approachable learning pipeline that walks a newcomer through AI-powered tooling, Mnemos utilities, and hands-on practice.

### Objectives (must all be addressed)

1. Survey and document the available AI tools (Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT).
2. Explain usage patterns for each tool (terminal commands, folder structure, prompt design, dependency installation).
3. Provide setup instructions (settings, plan tiers – free vs paid).
4. Introduce Mnemos utilities (MCP, pre-built prompts & rules, templates, `npx meshjs-<app-name>` scaffolding).
5. Walk through Mnemos setup (MCP, docs indexing, configuration).
6. Demonstrate day-to-day usage of Mnemos utilities.
7. Build a first ‘hello-world’ Cardano project – simple, small, approachable.
8. Supply a goal-oriented, provable practice workflow (consider incentives for completion).
9. Cover design theory & advanced AI tips.
10. GitHub workflow primer (branches, PRs, CI checks).
11. Overview of Cardano developer APIs (Blockfrost, Taptools, Charlie3, DexHunter, etc.).
12. Produce how-to videos, live coding sessions, and host interactive classes.

### Deliverables

- [ ] Public MNEMOS marketing/landing website (Next.js + Tailwind).
- [ ] Simplified docs & guides accessible to non-technical builders (MDX + search).
- [ ] Recorded live-coding sessions (Mesh YouTube).
- [ ] Step-by-step how-to videos (Mesh YouTube).
- [ ] Community forum channel on Mesh Discord.

### Evidence of Completion

Provide public URLs for:

1. Deployed MNEMOS website.
2. Docs & guides repository (open-source, SEO & AI-optimised).
3. Live-coding session recordings.
4. How-to video playlist.
5. Open-source MNEMOS GitHub repos (with license).
6. MNEMOS discussion channel in Mesh Discord.

## How to Use This Rule

When suggesting or implementing code:

1. Default to the best-practice guidelines from [nextjs-best-practices.mdc](mdc:nextjs-best-practices.mdc).
2. Align tasks, components, and folder structure with the objectives and deliverables above.
3. Keep PRs small and focused on a single objective.
4. Attach evidence links in PR descriptions when a deliverable is met.
5. Update this rule file’s checklists as items are completed (tick the boxes).
